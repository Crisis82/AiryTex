# Latex templates

Minimal pastel colored LaTex templates inspired by [Thud](https://github.com/miculan/thud) and [wildcat](https://github.com/aarondwolf/wildcat) templates, designed to give a fresh, modern and calming feeling to scientific papers and presentations.

The classes provided in this repository are:
- **academica**: built upon the standard *book* class (*i.e.*, papers/articles/journals);
- **presenta**: built upon the standard *beamer* class (*i.e.*, slides).

## Configuration

To apply any of these templates, just copy the folder of class that you want to use (*e.g.*, **academica** or **presenta**) into your working folder.
Then you just need to choose it as the used class by adding the following line at the beginning of your `main.tex` file:

```tex
\documentclass{academica/academica}
```
